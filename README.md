# **Merging, Cleaning and Aggregation of 2024 NYC Yellow Taxi Trip Data**

This project focuses on merging, cleaning and aggregating the yellow taxi data of the city of New York for the year 2024. The cleaning steps involve removing trips with unrealistic fare, trip distance, trip duration, pickup time, etc. Finally, the data is aggregated for the year 2024 to have a higher detail level and a more manageable dataset to analyze major trends and patterns of NYC yellow taxi trips.
